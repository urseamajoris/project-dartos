# File Upload and Processing Improvements - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major improvements made to fix file upload and processing issues in the Dartos application.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Network Error Issues
**Problem:** Users experiencing "network error" when uploading files, especially larger PDFs.

**Root Causes:**
- No timeout configuration in API client
- File size limit mismatch (frontend: 10MB, backend: 50MB)
- No upload progress feedback
- Large files timing out during upload

**Solutions:**
- Added 5-minute timeout to axios client
- Aligned file size limits (50MB on both frontend and backend)
- Implemented upload progress tracking
- Added progress bar in FileUpload component
- Better error messages for timeout scenarios

### 2. Silent Background Processing Failures
**Problem:** Documents uploaded successfully but processing failed silently in background tasks.

**Root Causes:**
- Background tasks had no error tracking
- No status updates to database
- No way for frontend to know if processing succeeded or failed
- Users couldn't see processing progress

**Solutions:**
- Added `status` field to Document model (uploaded → processing → indexed/processed/failed)
- Added `error_message` field to capture failure details
- Improved background task error handling with try/catch blocks
- Created status tracking endpoint (`/api/documents/{id}/status`)
- Frontend polls status and shows real-time updates
- Visual feedback with icons (spinner, success, error)

### 3. RAG System Issues
**Problem:** RAG service failing when embedding model couldn't be downloaded (offline scenarios).

**Root Causes:**
- RAG service tried to download embedding model from HuggingFace
- No fallback when network unavailable
- ChromaDB can use default embeddings but code didn't handle this

**Solutions:**
- Improved embedding model initialization with graceful degradation
- Falls back to ChromaDB's default embedding function when model unavailable
- Better logging to explain what's happening
- System works even without sentence-transformers model

### 4. LLM Input Pipeline
**Problem:** RAG chunks fed to LLM without proper structure, reducing answer quality.

**Root Causes:**
- Chunks concatenated with simple newlines
- No clear separation between context sections
- LLM couldn't easily reference specific chunks
- No metadata about chunk sources

**Solutions:**
- Created `_format_chunks_for_context()` method
- Numbered context sections ([Context Section 1], [Context Section 2], etc.)
- Added clear separators (---) between chunks
- Updated system prompt to encourage section citations
- Better structured prompts for LLM

### 5. Missing Error Feedback
**Problem:** Users didn't know when or why processing failed.

**Root Causes:**
- No error messages returned to frontend
- Background tasks failed silently
- No status tracking

**Solutions:**
- Error messages stored in database
- Returned in API responses
- Displayed in frontend with Alert components
- Clear status messages for each processing stage

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes

#### models.py
```python
# Added fields:
status = Column(String, default="uploaded")
error_message = Column(Text, nullable=True)
```

#### schemas.py
```python
# New schema for status tracking
class DocumentStatus(BaseModel):
    id: int
    filename: str
    status: str
    progress: str
    error_message: Optional[str] = None

# Updated DocumentResponse with error handling

    # ... existing fields ...
    error_message: Optional[str] = None
```

- New method: `getDocumentStatus(id)`
- Error message improvements

#### components/FileUpload.js
- Upload progress tracking with LinearProgress bar
- Status polling for background processing
- Visual status indicators (icons)
- Real-time status updates
- Error message display
- Increased file size limit to 50MB

## Processing Pipeline Flow

### Before Changes
```
Upload → Save to DB → Background task (silent) → ???
```

### After Changes
```
1. Upload (with progress bar)
   ↓ status: "uploaded"
2. Save to DB
   ↓
3. Background Task Starts
   ↓ status: "processing"
4. Extract Text (with error handling)
   ↓
5. Index in RAG (with retry logic)
   ↓ status: "indexed" or "processed" or "failed"
6. Frontend polls status every 2s
   ↓
7. Shows final status with icons/messages
```

## Status Values
- **uploaded**: Document uploaded, waiting for processing
- **processing**: Text extraction and indexing in progress
- **indexed**: Successfully processed and indexed in RAG
- **processed**: Processed but RAG indexing unavailable
- **failed**: Processing failed (with error_message)

## API Endpoints Added/Modified

### New Endpoint
```
GET /api/documents/{document_id}/status
Response: DocumentStatus
```

### Modified Endpoints
```
POST /api/upload
- Now returns status field
- Better error handling
- Starts background processing

GET /api/documents
- Returns status for each document
- Includes error_message if failed

GET /api/documents/{id}
- Returns full document with status
- Includes error_message if failed

POST /api/process
- Better error messages
- Checks for empty collection
- Improved context handling
```

## Testing

### New Test File: test_upload_workflow.py
Tests added for:
- Schema validation (DocumentResponse, DocumentStatus)
- Document model fields (status, error_message)
- LLM chunk formatting
- RAG offline mode handling

### Test Results
- All basic tests: ✅ 4/4 passed
- All workflow tests: ✅ 4/4 passed
- Security scan (CodeQL): ✅ 0 alerts

## Configuration Changes

### Timeout Settings
- Frontend axios: 5 minutes (300000ms)
- Uvicorn: 5 minutes keep-alive (300s)
- Graceful shutdown: 30 seconds

### File Size Limits
- Frontend: 50MB
- Backend: 50MB
- Aligned to prevent confusion

## Error Messages Examples

### Before
```
"Upload failed: Network Error"
```

### After
```
Frontend:
"Upload timeout - your file may be too large or the network is slow. Please try again with a smaller file."

Backend:
"Text extraction failed: Unable to read PDF structure"
"RAG indexing failed: ChromaDB connection error"
"No text could be extracted from the PDF"
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Feedback**: Users see upload progress bar
2. **Real-time Status**: Processing status updates every 2 seconds
3. **Clear Icons**: ✓ for success, ⚠ for errors, ⟳ for processing
4. **Error Messages**: Specific error details when something fails
5. **Larger Files**: Can now upload up to 50MB PDFs
6. **Faster Feedback**: Know immediately if something went wrong

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- New database fields have defaults
- API responses include new optional fields
- Old code will continue to work
- Migration not strictly required (fields added, none removed)

## Performance Improvements

1. Background processing doesn't block upload response
2. Status polling reduces unnecessary API calls
3. Better error handling prevents resource leaks
4. Structured logging helps debugging

## Logging Improvements

Added comprehensive logging:
- Document upload events
- Processing stages
- RAG operations
- LLM calls
- Error details with stack traces

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Chunked file upload for very large files (>50MB)
2. Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
3. Websocket for real-time status updates (instead of polling)
4. Progress percentages during text extraction
5. Document processing queue with priority
6. Batch upload support

## Migration Guide

For existing deployments:

1. **Database Migration** (if using production DB):
   ```python
   # Add columns to documents table
   ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'uploaded';
   ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN error_message TEXT;
   ```

2. **Update Environment**:
   - No new environment variables required
   - Existing GROK_API_KEY still optional

3. **Frontend Update**:
   - Rebuild frontend with new changes
   - No breaking changes to API

4. **Backend Update**:
   - Install dependencies (already in requirements.txt)
   - Restart backend service

## Security Considerations

- CodeQL scan: 0 alerts found
- No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- Proper error message sanitization
- File size limits enforced
- MIME type validation maintained
- Path traversal protection maintained

## Conclusion

These changes significantly improve the reliability and user experience of file upload and processing in Dartos. The system now:

1. ✅ Handles large files without network errors
2. ✅ Provides real-time processing feedback
3. ✅ Reports errors clearly to users
4. ✅ Works offline (without embedding model)
5. ✅ Structures LLM context better
6. ✅ Maintains all security best practices

All improvements maintain backward compatibility while adding robust error handling and status tracking throughout the upload-to-RAG pipeline.
